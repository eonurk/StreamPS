# StreamPS

Currently, there is no native way to stream from PS5 to [Kick.com](https://kick.com). This dashboard allows you to broadcast your Twitch stream to Kick.

1. Start a Twitch stream on PS5
2. Run the dashboard on local (npm run dev), which starts a webpage at https://localhost:3000
3. Enter your Twitch / Kick usernames, and Kick Stream Key (Channel > Stream URL & Key)
4. It automatically starts your Kick Stream!

## Desktop App (Electron)

You can run StreamPS as a downloadable desktop app (Electron) so users do not need Node on their machines. FFmpeg must be on the system PATH.
